<h1>User Story</h1>
<p>As someone who consistently is either working out or in physical therapy, I found keeping track of workouts was either a memory game or paper packet carrying simulator. Now I can consolidate all my workouts into one place. User will arrive at the home screen and be given the ability to log in by either creating an account or by logging in with their existing Google account. From there, user will be able to create a "Username" for each workout. Username can take the shape of a name of a person, workout, target of workout, etc. Once user creates a workout, they will be able to edit or delete that workout.</p>
<h1>Challenges I Faced:</h1>
<p>Overall I enjoyed using the technologies for this app however every second spent on this project felt and was literally a race against the clock. In addition,
hardware bugs were a consistent and annoying error. The biggest problem I found I had ran into, however, was that I neglected to work within a team and instead decided to be in a group by myself. A lot of the time I could of spent really solidifying my knowledge was constantly occupied by the pressure of having to finish the project before the instructed deadline. To get over these problems in the future, I plan to repeat all the steps that made me uncomfortable during the making of the project until I feel comfortable. Every project is a learning experience and this was certainly no exception.</p>
<h1>Future Plans(icebox):</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Add real-time, multi-user interaction</li>
    <li>Add user picture when logged in</li>
    <li>Have preset list of workout types (ie cardio, upper body, chest, back, calf) to make UX quicker for user</li>
    <li>Add private route feature for nav bar</li>
    <li>Add feature that cycles quotes and background image based on user's selected theme</li>
    <li>Create the ability for users to categorize based on the properties of the workout (ie can filter all their chest workouts into one page)</li>
  </ul>
